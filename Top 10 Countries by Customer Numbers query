-- Step 1: Top 10 Countries by Customer Numbers
-- SQL Query to find the top 10 countries with the highest number of customers

SELECT 
    C.country,  -- Selecting the country name
    COUNT(DISTINCT CU.customer_id) AS num_customers  -- Counting distinct customer IDs per country
FROM 
    customer CU  -- Main customer table alias
JOIN 
    address A ON CU.address_id = A.address_id  -- Joining customer to address table
JOIN 
    city CI ON A.city_id = CI.city_id  -- Joining address to city table
JOIN 
    country C ON CI.country_id = C.country_id  -- Joining city to country table
GROUP BY 
    C.country  -- Grouping by country to aggregate customer counts
ORDER BY 
    num_customers DESC  -- Sorting countries by number of customers in descending order
LIMIT 10;  -- Limiting the result to the top 10 countries
